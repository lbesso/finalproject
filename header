        <!-- intro paragraph -->
        <p> The Inconceivable Theatre Company was started in 2014 by a group of friends, 
            all local Vermont teens/youths, in order to produce a show that they wanted 
            to do together, which is why our first show, "Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long Blog" 
            happened in August of 2015. We also did a large Shakespearian fundraiser 
            the spring of 2016 and then another full musical, "Coraline the Musical"
            in August of 2016.  </p>
